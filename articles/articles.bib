                  research. Most geneticists are taught classical statistics,
                  which includes hypothesis testing, estimation and the
                  construction of confidence intervals; this framework has
                  proved more than satisfactory in many ways. What does a
                  Bayesian framework have to offer geneticists? Its utility lies
                  in offering a more direct approach to some questions and the
                  incorporation of prior information. It can also provide a more
                  straightforward interpretation of results. The utility of a
                  Bayesian perspective, especially for complex problems, is
                  becoming increasingly clear to the statistics community;
                  geneticists are also finding this framework useful and are
                  increasingly utilizing the power of this approach.},

  abstract =     { High-fecundity organisms, such as Atlantic cod, can withstand
                  substantial natural selection and the entailing genetic load
                  of replacing alleles at a number of loci due to their excess
                  reproductive capacity. High-fecundity organisms may reproduce
                  by sweepstakes leading to highly skewed heavy-tailed offspring
                  distribution. Under such reproduction the Kingman coalescent
                  of binary mergers breaks down and models of multiple merger
                  coalescent are more appropriate. Here we study nucleotide
                  variation at the \textit{Ckma} (Creatine Kinase Muscle type A)
                  gene in Atlantic cod. The gene shows extreme differentiation
                  between the North (Canada, Greenland, Iceland, Norway, Barents
                  Sea) and the South (Faroe Islands, North-, Baltic-, Celtic-,
                  and Irish Seas) with \textit{F\textsubscript{ST}} > 0.8
                  between regions whereas neutral loci show no differentiation.
                  This is evidence of natural selection. The protein sequence is
                  conserved by purifying selection whereas silent and non-coding
                  sites show extreme differentiation. The unfolded
                  site-frequency spectrum has three modes, a mode at singleton
                  sites and two high frequency modes at opposite frequencies
                  representing divergent branches of the gene genealogy that is
                  evidence for balancing selection. Analysis with
                  multiple-merger coalescent models can account for the high
                  frequency of singleton sites and indicate reproductive
                  sweepstakes. Coalescent time scales vary with population size
                  and with the inverse of variance in offspring number.
                  Parameter estimates using multiple-merger coalescent models
                  show that times scales are faster than under the Kingman
                  coalescent. },
