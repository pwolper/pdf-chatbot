  abstract        = {Statistical analyses are used in many fields of genetic
                  research. Most geneticists are taught classical statistics,
                  which includes hypothesis testing, estimation and the
                  construction of confidence intervals; this framework has
                  proved more than satisfactory in many ways. What does a
                  Bayesian framework have to offer geneticists? Its utility lies
                  in offering a more direct approach to some questions and the
                  incorporation of prior information. It can also provide a more
                  straightforward interpretation of results. The utility of a
                  Bayesian perspective, especially for complex problems, is
                  becoming increasingly clear to the statistics community;
                  geneticists are also finding this framework useful and are
                  increasingly utilizing the power of this approach.},
